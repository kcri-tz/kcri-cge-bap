# BAP - run the BAP in the kcri-cge-bap container.
#
#   This is just a shorthand for ./bap-container-run BAP ...
#
# NOTE: You must set the BAP_IMAGE and BAP_DB_DIR environment variables
#       in the bap-container-run script, or else on every invocation.
#
# ALSO: You can then override these variables (as well as BAP_WORK_DIR
#       which defaults to $PWD) by setting them in the environment.
