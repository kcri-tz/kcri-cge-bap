# kcri-cge-bap - ext

This directory contains external packages and binaries that are to be
installed in the Docker image.  On initial cloning of the repository it
is empty.  Use `./update-backend.sh` to fill it.

Note that not all content of this directory is copied into the Docker
image, thanks to the exclusions listed in `../.dockerignore`.
